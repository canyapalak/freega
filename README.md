# freega

<h2>An API project for video games to play free, built with pure Javascript</h2>

<h2>Functinality and purpose of the application</h2>
<p>
This is a website, which offers a comprehensive list of games available for online play. Freega is built using the freetogame.com API, which provides detailed information such as the publisher, thumbnail, genre, description, release year, and platform for each game.

A search function and filtering method have been included to allow users to easily find games that meet their preferences by filtering games by genre and platform. The website is built using JavaScript to fetch and use the API, and Bootstrap has been used to ensure responsiveness and clean styling.

The primary purpose of this project was to gain an understanding of APIs and their usage with JavaScript, as well as practice on some basic functions like filtering and search.
