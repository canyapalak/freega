            <p>Video games are no doubt one of the greatest sources of entertainment of our era. Accessing this resource can sometimes
            push the budget, therefore people find the solution to this problem with free video games, which can be played with an
            average computer or even on a simple browser.</p>
            <p>For the regular player, perhaps the biggest advantage to the current model is the fact that games are indeed free to
            play. There's no risk involved for the user. All they have to do is download the game, give it a try and see if they
            like it. If so, great they can keep playing. If not, then they can just delete it. Further, they can expect that all
            future content for that game will also be delivered free of charge. It's really quite nice in that regard.</p>
            <span id="more-text"><p>It is even easier with the browser games. Browser games that were ignored by the gaming community because they were
            simple until a few years ago are now a popular platform for free games just like PC games.</p>
            <p>Freega! was created for people who want to access and learn about free-to-play video games. Here you can filter the
            large database of free games by different parameters like genre and platform or search a title by name. Enjoy it!</p></span>
